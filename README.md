# Watermark
Add watermark to screenshots or images in your clipboard and and automatically copy the path to it

Made this because I wanted a quick way to watermark my edits for r/PhotoshopRequest and 
all websites I found online took way too much time to watermark and then save to my desktop 
and then upload it. By that time someone would already have made an edit.

### Before
